-> Backend built using .NET Core Web API

-> Connected to SQL Server instead of PostgreSQL (no data is stored, as historical weather storage is not required)

-> Frontend developed using React+Js (instead of Vue)

-> Displays current weather based on city input

-> Displays historical weather for selected dates by reusing the current weather API (since actual historical API is paid)
